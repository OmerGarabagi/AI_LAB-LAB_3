### Conclusions from the benchmark + plot

| Algorithm | Best value `f*` | What that tells us                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GA**    | **4 × 10-2**    | Reached the inner “funnel” of the Ackley landscape; only a few × 10-2 above the true minimum **0**.                                |
| **SA**    | 6 × 10-2        | Also inside the funnel; very similar location to GA (their dots lie on top of each other in the plot).                             |
| **TS**    | 3 × 10-1        | Crossed the plateau, but stopped on one of the shallow ripples around the basin, so still an order of magnitude higher than GA/SA. |

**What “converging to the global minimum” means here**

* **Ackley’s optimum is exactly 0 at (0,…,0).**
* Any value below ≈ 1 × 10-1 in 10 dimensions shows the optimiser has escaped the outer plateau (f ≈ 20) and descended into the narrow central basin.
* GA and SA both achieved < 0.1, i.e. they effectively reached the global valley.
* TS reached < 0.3, which is still a big improvement over random search but indicates its parameters (neighbourhood size, tabu tenure, move variance) could use further tuning or more function evaluations.

**Bottom line**

* **Yes – all three algorithms demonstrate the ability to home in on the global minimum.**
* GA and SA already get very close with the current 50 k-evaluation budget; TS needs either a larger neighbourhood, a lighter tabu tenure, or simply more evaluations to catch up.
